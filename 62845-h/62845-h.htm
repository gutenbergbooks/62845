<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="{Illustrated capital}" width="81" height="100" />
</div>
<p>The Town of Plymouth, made famous as the
permanent settlement of the Pilgrims, is
the county seat of Plymouth County in
southeastern Massachusetts. It is 37 miles southeast
of Boston and is reached by rail, and by Routes
north via the Old Colony Division of the N. Y.,
N. H. &amp; H. R. R., and by automobile over routes
No. 3 and No. 3A. It overlooks Cape Cod Bay and
a well protected harbor. Its year &rsquo;round population
is approximately 14,000. It has an area of 108
square miles, the largest in the State.</p>
<p>In addition to its historical association and its
old records, among which one may browse at
pleasure, the town has a fine public school system,
public library, many churches, an excellent water
system, several banks and theatres, an adequate
fire and police department, a modernized hospital
and high quality of public service. There are fine
bathing beaches and recreational centers, hotels
and accommodation for tourists.</p>
<p>Fraternal organizations are numerous. The Old
Colony Club, organized 1769, the oldest social
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
organization in America, is located on Court Street,
opposite the Court House. Other active societies
are the Plymouth Woman&rsquo;s Club, the Plymouth
Antiquarian Society, the Cordage Men&rsquo;s Club, the
Plymouth Country Club, the Girls&rsquo; Club, the Boys&rsquo;
Club, the New Century Club, and the Manomet
Village Club.</p>
<p>The Plymouth County Court House occupies a
commanding position facing Court Street with the
Registry of Deeds near at hand on North Russell
Street and easily accessible to visitors. A new
Federal Post Office Building stands at the historic
corner of Leyden and Main Streets. A commodious
armory on Court Street accommodates the
National Guard. At one time this building was the
headquarters of the Standish Guards, the local
militia company organized and chartered in 1818.</p>
<p>Opposite the armory is Plymouth&rsquo;s Memorial
Building, dedicated in 1926 to the men of Plymouth
who served in all the wars in which the country
has been engaged. It has a large hall with a seating
capacity of 2000 and was built at a cost of
$300,000. This building is a few steps north of
Pilgrim Hall, that sacred depository of Pilgrimiana,
a mecca for modern day Pilgrims, visited
every year by thousands from the world over.</p>
<p>The town has diversified industries. Its mills
and factories are devoted principally to the production
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
of high grade woolens, cordage, tacks and
rivets, and zinc products.</p>

<p class="pcap">AN ISLAND IN ONE OF PLYMOUTH&rsquo;S MANY PONDS</p>
</div>
<p>Over 300 ponds of sparkling clear water lie within
the town&rsquo;s boundaries, and these together with
its woodlands offer almost unlimited facilities for
hunting and fishing, while salt water fishing is
equally available.</p>
<p>Yes, Plymouth has much to offer as a place for
permanent residence and as a summer resort.</p>
<p>The door is open and the word is <i>Welcome</i>.</p>
<p>Approaching Plymouth from the north and passing
through Kingston, it is both convenient and
of interest to visit the Major John Bradford House.
This house stands on a knoll on Landing Road
overlooking Jones River and the marshes. It was
built in 1674 by Major John Bradford, son of Major
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
William Bradford, Deputy Governor and Grandson
of Governor William Bradford.</p>
<p><i>Legend:</i></p>
<p>During the King Philip War this house was partially
burned while Major Bradford was moving
his family to a place of safety. Upon his return
Indians were seen surrounding the house, one of
whom the Major shot while he was in the act of
warning his comrades of the approach of the
whites. This Indian, while wounded, crawled behind
a fallen tree and some years later told Major
Bradford of the circumstances of his escape, showing
at the same time the bullet wound in his side
received at the time.</p>
<p>Another fact of interest is that this house gave
shelter for something like twenty-five years to the
now famous &ldquo;History of Plimouth Plantation,&rdquo;
sometimes spoken of as the &ldquo;Bradford History&rdquo;
written by Governor Bradford and preserved in
the State House in Boston.</p>
<p>Entering Plymouth through Court Street and
passing the plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company,
one comes to another old house. This house
is known as the William Crowe House. It is located
on the east side of the highway and was probably
built in 1664 as in that year William Crowe married
Hannah, daughter of the first Josiah Winslow.
A deed dated 1665 from Francis Billington to
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
William Crowe refers to the estate &ldquo;on which Mr.
Crowe now lives.&rdquo; This undoubtedly establishes
the house as one of the very oldest of Plymouth&rsquo;s
old houses.</p>
<p>Mr. Crowe&rsquo;s widow married John Sturtevant.
Her daughter Hannah Sturtevant married Josiah
Cotton, a grandson of Rev. John Cotton. In 1709
Mr. Cotton became the owner, and in 1723 built
the two-story addition.</p>
<p>Proceeding south through Court Street and turning
west at Allerton or Cushman Street brings one
to the National Monument of the Forefathers.</p>
<p>... This monument, towering high in its massive
splendor, occupies a commanding position
overlooking the town and harbor, with Duxbury,
Clark&rsquo;s Island, the Saquish and the Gurnet in the
background.</p>
<p>The central figure is <i>Faith</i>, which stands on the
main pedestal, one foot resting on a replica of
Plymouth Rock. In the left hand is a Bible, while
the right hand points heavenward. The whole
attitude is symbolic of faith in a divine power, as
the smaller statues below are representative of the
principles enunciated by the Pilgrims themselves.</p>
<p>The plan of the base is octagonal. There are four
protruding wings, on each of which is a figure
seated. One representing Morality holding the
decalogue in the left hand and the scroll of Revelation
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
in the right. On the one side is a Prophet and
on the other the Evangelists.</p>
<p>On the next pedestal is the figure representing
Law with Justice on one side and Mercy on the
other, symbolizing justice tempered with mercy.
Education has on the one hand the wisdom of
maturity and on the other Youth following experience.
The fourth figure represents Freedom, a consequence
of which is peace, represented on the
one hand, while on the other is represented the
overthrow of tyranny.</p>
<p>The main pedestal has four polished faces, on
two of which are inscribed the names of the Mayflower
Pilgrims, while another bears the inscription
&ldquo;National Monument to the Forefathers.
Erected by a grateful people in remembrance of
their labors, sacrifices and sufferings for the cause
of civil and religious liberty.&rdquo; There is one panel
left for future use.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="{Illustrated capital}" width="83" height="100" />
</div>
<p>On a 100-acre tract, formerly part of the
beautiful Hornblower estate, a replica of
the Pilgrim First Street (now Leyden
Street) with its original nineteen thatched dwellings
is being erected under the auspices of Plimoth
Plantation, Inc. When complete the project
will have cost an estimated million dollars.</p>
<p>Nearby, in a bend in the Eel River, is the permanent
anchorage of the Mayflower II, an exact
reproduction of the original Pilgrim ship, built
and financed by popular subscription in England.</p>
<p>The idea of reproducing a full-size, 92-foot
180-ton Mayflower replica was conceived during
the North African fighting in World War II by a
Londoner, Warwick Charlton. His dream was to
memorialize the common heritage of English-speaking
peoples, and to express his country&rsquo;s
gratitude for American aid in times of great stress.</p>
<p>Mayflower II was constructed of English oak
and Oregon pine at an ancient shipyard in Brixham,
Devon, using plans drawn up, after five
years of research, by William A. Baker, shipyard
executive with Bethlehem Steel. More than a
quarter million English people contributed shillings
and pence to the Project Mayflower fund.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim village is located on a park-like
site sloping up from Eel River. When complete
it will include a trading post, grist mill, Indian
village, and a fort meeting house, as well as
dwellings identical with those occupied by Governor
Bradford, Elder Brewster, Myles Standish,
John Alden, and the rest. The work is being supervised
by Charles R. Strickland, Plimoth Plantation
architect.</p>
<p>The Plantation homes are designed to have the
vertical planked siding, thatched roofs, and
sheepskin parchment windows of Tudor times.
They are being furnished with trestle tables,
benches, trundle beds, sea chests, and the like.
Women in costume working at old looms will
weave linsey-woolsey, and dye it with butternut
hull and hemlock bark decoctions.</p>
<p>Mayflower II comes to its permanent berth in
the Eel River after an Atlantic crossing, and exhibitions
at New York and elsewhere, under the
command of Alan Villiers, of grain-ship fame.
The ship will symbolize the wellsprings of American
democracy. It will vividly recall the ideas
forever shrined in the Compact, whereby the
little company of dissenters bound themselves to
live together by the law and under God.</p>
<p>All America will want to see how their nation
was cradled, and so more keenly appreciate the
noble tradition to which they are heir.</p>

<p>Leaving the Monument and passing south
through Allerton Street, crossing Samoset

hill to the Cornish and Burton Schools, we arrive
at the northwest entrance to the old burial ground.
Rising 165 feet above sea level this hill commands
a fine view of the harbor and bay from Kingston
and Duxbury on the north to the Pine Hills on the
south. At the base of the hill is Town Square
where in the immediate foreground rise the spires
of the First Church (Unitarian) and the Church

<p class="pcapc">Burial Hill, once called
&ldquo;Fort Hill,&rdquo; is one of
the most historic and
beautiful spots in Pilgrim
Plymouth. There
are convenient seats
under the shady trees
where one can rest and
look out over Plymouth
Harbor and Cape Cod
Bay. Here on the &ldquo;Hill&rdquo;
are the graves of the
early colonists, the site
of the Watch Tower,
the Replica of the Powder

the &ldquo;Fort.&rdquo; People
come here from all over
the world to search for
the graves of their ancestors.
The guide map,
giving location of all
the graves, which is included
in the Pilgrim
Book of Burial Hill and
Its Epitaphs, is invaluable to those who wish to get the most out of their visit to Pilgrim Plymouth. In
leaving Burial Hill by the Town Square entrance, note the view down Leyden Street, first street in New

<p>There is no record of its first use as a burial
ground. There are six stones bearing dates of the
17th century, the oldest that of Edward Grey
(1681). It is known that William Bradford died
in 1657 and a monument erected in 1825 bears
evidence to that fact. Also that John Howland
died in 1672 and his present stone was erected
(circa) 1850. It is presumable that there were
many burials here prior to these dates, although
the first burials were on Cole&rsquo;s Hill just above the

<p class="pcap">ONE OF MANY OLD STONES ON BURIAL HILL</p>
</div>
<p>There is a doubt concerning the last named as
the inscription is now illegible, but his death is
supposed to have occurred in 1697.</p>
<p>Near the northwest entrance through which we
entered is the replica of the old Powder House
built in 1770 and later demolished. The present
structure was a gift of the Massachusetts Society
of the Sons of the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Burial Hill was well chosen as the site of the
first fort. As it was easily approachable from
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
First Street (now Leyden) and commanded the
surrounding territory for some distance in all
directions, it served as an excellent defense
against attack by Indians. The locations of the
fort and watch tower are marked by appropriately
inscribed tablets.</p>
<p>But a few steps away to the north is the grave
of Gov. William Bradford (numbered 32) over
which stands a marble shaft erected in 1825,
bearing the Latin inscription, the free translation
of which is: &ldquo;What our Fathers with so much
difficulty attained, do not basely relinquish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inscription on the south side reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>H. I. William Bradford of Austerfield, Yorkshire,
England. Was the son of William and Alice
Bradford. He was Governor of Plymouth Colony
from 1621 to 1633, 1635 to 1637, 1639 to 1643,
1645 to 1657.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inscription on the north side follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under this stone rest the ashes of William
Bradford, a zealous Puritan and sincere Christian
Gov. of Ply. Col. from 1621 to 1657, (the year he
died, aged 69) except 5 yrs. which he declined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a text in Hebrew, now almost
obliterated, which has been translated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let the right hand of the Lord awake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descendants of Governor William Bradford are
buried in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>No. 33&mdash;Major William Bradford, Dep. Gov. of
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Plymouth Colony, and a son of Gov. Bradford.
The inscription on this stone is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here lyes ye body of ye honorable Major
William Bradford who expired Feb&rsquo; ye 20th.
1703-4 aged 79 years.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He lived long, but still was doing good,</p>

<p class="t0">His very name and memory is blest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At the grave of Joseph Bradford, another son,
the inscription on the stone reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here lyes ye body of Joseph Bradford, son of

<p>Judge Russell was a native of Plymouth, the
son of Thomas and Mary Ann (Goodwin) Russell.
He was a noted jurist, was appointed by President
Grant United States Minister to Venezuela and
was President of the Pilgrim Society on the occasion
of General Grant&rsquo;s visit to Plymouth. His

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">TOWN SQUARE AND CHURCHES</span></h2>
<p>Leaving the hill at the southeast slope and following
down the terraced brick and granite walk,
we step into Town Square. This is the logical
center of the town and it may well be said, for
generations the seat of government with the Town
House on the south side, bearing its descriptive
tablet. Just ahead is the first street leading to the
water and reaching to the north is Main Street.</p>
<p>Let us here face about. As we look up the square
we face the First Church (Unitarian), so called by
virtue of its succession of unbroken records, the
oldest volume of which may be seen in Pilgrim
Hall. This church was dedicated on Dec. 21, 1899.
Its arched portal is an elaborate copy of the portal
of the church at Austerfield, England, in which
Gov. Bradford was christened. A tablet near the
entrance bears the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church of Scrooby, Leyden, and the Mayflower
gathered on this hillside in 1620, has ever
since preserved unbroken records and maintained
a continuous ministry, its first covenant being
still the basis of its fellowship. In reverent
memory of its Pilgrim founders this fifth meeting
house was erected A. D. MDCCCXCVII.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the east end of the church is a memorial
window representing John Robinson delivering
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
his farewell address to the Pilgrims. This window
is an artistic masterpiece. It was designed by
Edward P. Sperry and since its installation it has
been an object of much interest to visitors to
Plymouth. Numerous other windows are commemorative
of historic events.</p>
<p>The wood church of Gothic design occupying
this site previous to erection of the present edifice,
was built in 1830 and was destroyed by fire on
Nov. 22, 1892.</p>
<p>On the right of the square is the Congregational
Church, or Church of the Pilgrimage, erected in
1840, on which is a tablet with the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tablet is inscribed in grateful memory of
the Pilgrims and of their successors who, at the
time of the Unitarian controversy in 1801, adhered
to the belief of the Fathers, and on the
basis of the original creed and covenant perpetuated,
at great sacrifice, in the Church of the
Pilgrimage, the evangelical faith and fellowship
of the Church of Scrooby, Leyden, and the &ldquo;Mayflower&rdquo;
organized in England in 1606.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first meeting house was erected in 1637 near
the Gov. Bradford House. This building contained
a bell, as did the more pretentious building erected
in 1683 with its diamond leaded windows, Gothic
roof, etc. In 1744 still another place of worship
was erected nearer the site of the present First
Church, and this remained until 1830, when the
church that preceded the present church was built.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Considering Town Square as a focal point, there
are several divergent routes one may take, each
contributing its legacy of historical interest.</p>

<p>Let us now leave Town Square and wend our
way along Leyden Street, so named in 1823, originally
called First Street and later Great and
Broad Street. On the right as we move easterly
toward the water we see, on the site of the Elder
Brewster homestead, the new Federal Building,
in which is located the Customs House and Post
Office. This is on the corner of Leyden Street and
Main Street Extension, the latter extending over
Town Brook referred to in Bradford&rsquo;s History as
&ldquo;a very sweete brooke,&rdquo; and which runs parallel
with Leyden Street, emptying into the harbor just
below.</p>

</div>
<p>A spot both picturesque and historical lies
to the south of Leyden Street bordering
Town Brook. It covers land first allotted
to William Brewster, John Goodman and Peter
Brown in the original lay-out. The gardens in the
rear extended downwards to the brook.</p>
<p>In the early days the estuary at the mouth of the
stream was sufficiently wide and deep at high tide
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
to permit the passing of fishing boats to what is
now the third bridge. Many small craft &ldquo;tied up&rdquo;
here during the winter months and periods of bad
weather. Later a dam was built at the mouth of
the stream and for generations water extended
over an area of several acres.</p>
<p>The reclamation of this area was a part of the
Tercentenary program. It was drained and
graded, and the brook now follows its natural
course through the park, now known as Brewster
Gardens. The old English or Dutch gardens in the
rear of the houses fronting on Leyden Street
present a decided contrast.</p>
<p>Near the brook stands Henry H. Kitson&rsquo;s statue
of the Pilgrim Maiden mounted upon a native
boulder and impressive in its sublimity. It seems
to symbolize the courage and determination with
which the adversities confronting the colonists
were met and overcome. It was presented to the
town by the National Society of New England
Women, and bears the inscription&mdash;&ldquo;To those
intrepid English women, whose courage, fortitude
and devotion brought a new nation into being,
this statue of the Pilgrim Maiden is dedicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close at hand is the spring that supplied &ldquo;sweete
water&rdquo; in the days of the Pilgrims. Water from
this spring has been piped to the street above and
supplies a drinking fountain near the Post Office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>A flight of stone steps designed by Fletcher
Steele leads to this park.</p>
<p>Another memorial not to be overlooked is the
stone seat also designed by Fletcher Steele and
presented to the town by the National Society of
Daughters of the American Colonists who came in
the ship Ann in 1623.</p>

<p>Much of the credit for reclaiming this area so
closely associated with the lives of the Pilgrims
and developing this beautiful park is due Mrs.
William H. Forbes of Milton whose father, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, married Miss Lidian Jackson,
daughter of Charles Jackson, in the old Winslow
House shown on another page. This park is
reached from both Water Street and Main Street
Extension.</p>
<p>The points of greatest historical interest are so
closely related in regard to location that to attempt
to prescribe a definite route would be extremely
difficult.</p>
<p>The most important points of interest are within
easy walking distance. As a suggestion, however,
one might follow Water Street from Brewster
Gardens north and find the historic Rock within a
two minutes&rsquo; walk.</p>
<p>During the Tercentenary celebration many
changes were made in this section. The old
wharves and buildings that had characterized this
spot for generations, are gone and the immediate
surroundings have been converted into a state
reservation. It is a ground made sacred to the
memory of the Pilgrims as is evidenced by the
many memorials and markers in the vicinity, gifts
of the various historical societies throughout the
country.</p>

<p class="pcap">PLYMOUTH ROCK&mdash;A NATIONAL SHRINE</p>
</div>
<p>Plymouth Rock, emblematic and suggestive of
the Pilgrim associations has been viewed by countless
thousands of people, not only from our own
states, but the world over. It has been photographed,
painted, and reproduced in bronze. On
this rock the Pilgrims first stepped foot, December
21st, 1620. To those who may be prone to scepticism
it can be stated that its interesting history has been
handed down from generation to generation from
Elder Thomas Faunce, who was born in Plymouth
in 1647, and who died in 1746, aged 99 years. A few
years before his death, at a time when removal or
covering up of the rock was under contemplation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
he made vigorous protest at what he termed the
desecration of an object of deep veneration, stating
that his father, John Faunce, who came over in the
Ann in 1623, had told him that it was on that rock
that the forefathers landed, as stated by them to
him.</p>
<p>It is further possible that an early age some of
the eldest of the Mayflower passengers may have
imparted this information to Elder Faunce directly.
During the war of the Revolution, an attempt was
made to remove the rock to Town Square, there to
be viewed as an emblem of liberty, civic and religious.
In the operation of lifting, the upper portion
split away, leaving the base in its original bed.
This top portion was, however, transferred to the
square, where it remained until 1834, when it was
taken to Pilgrim Hall and placed within an iron
fence at the left of the entrance. In 1880 it was
moved back and cemented to its original base.</p>
<p>In the vicinity where the Rock now rests there
were once many wharves and industrial enterprises.
Plymouth was then an active and busy
seaport but all this was changed when the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts bought this land in
1920 and made it into a reservation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The memorial pictured below, standing close to
the Rock and Peristyle, is symbolic of the part
played by the women of the Plymouth Colony in
shaping the destinies of this,
the first permanent settlement.
Their courage and
fortitude fill a glorious page

colonization.</p>

the lack of proper accommodations after the
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>

frightful inroads on the little colony, their number
being reduced one-half during the first few months,
and those remaining being &ldquo;scarce able to bury

<p>They were reduced so fast and to such an extent
that it was deemed wise to conceal the graves, so
they planted corn that Indians might remain in
ignorance of their great losses. At various times
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in the process of excavating, human remains have
been uncovered. These were carefully re-interred
and a granite slab bearing an appropriate inscription
now marks the spot and conveys to the visitor
a mute attest to the sacrifices of those who contributed
their part in shaping the destinies of our
country.</p>
<p>Remains that were found during excavations for
a water main on Carver Street in 1855 were, upon
their identification as those of the Caucasian race
as distinguished from the native Indians, placed in
a vault on Burial Hill. Later, upon completion of
the canopy over Plymouth Rock in 1867, they were
placed in a receptacle in the top of that memorial.
They now repose in the Sarcophagus erected under
the direction and at the expense of the General
Society of Mayflower Descendants.</p>
<p>During the Revolutionary War and the War of
1812 batteries were implanted on the brow of the
hill to protect the town from approach by water.</p>
<p>A memorial seat on Cole&rsquo;s Hill was erected in

<p class="pcap">THE EDWARD WINSLOW HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>Winslow Street curves north from lower North
Street and enters Water Street a short distance
beyond. At the apex of the curve stands the house
built in 1754 by Edward Winslow, great-grandson
of Gov. Edward Winslow of the Plymouth Colony.
The timbers used in its construction were brought
from England. As shown, the house is an elaboration
of the house in its original form. The trees in
front of the house were planted by Edward
Winslow&rsquo;s daughter in 1760.</p>
<p>This property has been acquired by the National
Society of Mayflower Descendants.</p>
<p>The above picture shows the Winslow House in
its reconstruction. It was in this house that Ralph
Waldo Emerson married Miss Lidian Jackson,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
daughter of Charles and Lucy (Cotton) Jackson
who, at the time, occupied the house. It was later
the residence of Rev. George Ware Briggs, long
identified with the First Church in Plymouth.</p>
<p>Passing up North Street, shaded by its arch of
lindens, we come to the house of Gen. John
Winslow, built in 1730. This building stands at
the corner of Main and North Streets and is now a
business block. It was upon Gen. Winslow, who
was a brother of Edward Winslow, that fell the
unpleasant burden of removing the neutral Arcadians
from Nova Scotia. This historic building
was later the home of James Warren, President
of the Provincial Congress, who married Mercy
Otis, sister of James Otis, the brilliant champion
of American rights.</p>
<p>We are now in Shirley Square, the town&rsquo;s
business center.</p>
<p>It may be observed that North Street and Leyden
Street run parallel toward the water, Carver Street
following the curve on Cole&rsquo;s Hill connecting with
both streets at the north and south sides of the
hill. Middle Street, starting at Main, runs between
North and Leyden Streets and ends at the hill.</p>
<p>To those who have not visited Plymouth in
recent years, the transition of Court and North
Streets from their quiet residential charm, to
avenues of commercial enterprise, will be noticeable.
It is the inevitable contribution to expansion
and progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Let us turn right here and proceed north on
Court Street. A few steps takes us to the Plymouth
County Court House and the Registry of Deeds.</p>
<p>The Plymouth County Court House stands
between North and South Russell Streets with its
wide expanse of lawn extending to Court Street.
From here one looks down Brewster Street to the
harbor. On the northerly corner of Brewster and
Court Streets is the Methodist Church. On the
southerly corner, the home of the Old Colony Club.</p>
<p>The Court House was erected in 1820 and was
remodeled in 1857. It contains, beside the court
rooms, accommodations for the various county
offices.</p>
<p>During recent years the houses on the south side
of South Russell Street running westerly from
School Street have been removed and Burial Hill
has been extended to the corner. This change
brings the historic hill into view across the Court
House lawn as one approaches from the north.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="{Illustrated capital}" width="83" height="100" />
</div>
<p>On North Russell Street stands the Registry
of Deeds, a fireproof building erected in
1904. To the antiquarian and those interested
in historical data, this building would rank
next to Pilgrim Hall, if not first in importance. It
contains papers of unusual interest, including
many signed by Pilgrim hands, as well as those
bearing the identifying signs or marks of the native
Indians.</p>
<p>There are deeds in the native language, Gov.
Bradford&rsquo;s order for trial by jury, various laws
pertaining to the guidance of the colony and of
the division of land, including a plan of the laying
out of the first street (now Leyden Street).</p>
<p>The second patent, dated 1629, granted by the
Earl of Warwick, may be seen in the original box
in which it came from England.</p>
<p>The distribution of milk from the cows imported
from England is even provided for. This was a
matter of much concern as the supply was short
and the demand great, to which these papers bear
attest. The Registry of Probate occupies the
second floor of the building.</p>
<p>Continuing along Court Street to Chilton Street
we come to Pilgrim Hall, stopping at the Tabitha
Plasket House on the way.</p>

<p class="pcap">TABITHA PLASKET HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>This house, pictured above, was built in 1722 by
Consider Howland, great-grandson of John Howland,
who came in the Mayflower. A considerable
part of the original structure still remains. It was
occupied for some years by Tabitha Plasket, said
to have been the first woman school teacher, and
a person of strong personality and rigorous
discipline. It is recorded that she hung unruly
scholars to the wall by placing a skein of yarn
under the arms as a corrective measure. The
house is located on the east side of Court Street,
between the Court House and Pilgrim Hall.</p>

<p>One is awakened to the realism of the early

history, where repose many articles brought over
in the Mayflower and closely associated with the
daily life of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p class="pcap">INTERIOR VIEW OF PILGRIM HALL MUSEUM</p>
</div>
<p>This building on the easterly side of Court
Street, a short distance north of the Court House,
was erected by the Pilgrim Society in 1824 in
memory of the Pilgrims and as a depository for
historical relics; In 1880 material improvements
were made in the original structure, largely
through the generosity of the late Joseph Henry
Stickney of Baltimore who had always taken an
intense interest in matters concerning the early
colony. At the time, the top portion of Plymouth
Rock, which had for 46 years been resting at one
side of the entrance to the hall, the latter part of
the time enclosed by an iron fence, was moved back
to its original bed and placed on the base where it
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
has since remained. Later in 1911-12 the Pilgrim
Society spent approximately $15,000 in completing
the work already inaugurated by Mr. Stickney,
making the building practically fireproof with
its steel beams, terra cotta and cement tiles,
marble floors, etc. Its Doric portico is impressive
in its dignity and will be easily recognized as one
approaches from either direction.</p>

<h3 id="c13">AN HISTORICAL COLLECTION</h3>
<p>The following are only a few of the interesting
treasures within the hall:</p>
<p>Picture of the &ldquo;Landing,&rdquo; in vestibule of Hall.
Given by R. G. Shaw of Boston.</p>
<p>Picture of the &ldquo;Landing,&rdquo; 13 x 16 feet, by Henry
Sargent of Boston and presented by him in 1834.

<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Copy of Weir&rsquo;s Embarkation from Delft Haven.
Painted by Edgar Parker. South wall of hall.</p>
<p>Departure from Delft Haven, by Charles Lucy.
Presented by Alexander H. Rice, former governor
of Massachusetts. This picture won first prize of
one thousand guineas at an exhibition in England.
Of great value. West wall.</p>
<p>Original of Weir&rsquo;s Embarkation of the Pilgrims
from Delft Haven. Purchased by the Society in
1914 (Weir&rsquo;s picture in the rotunda of the Capitol
at Washington is an enlargement from this study).</p>
<p>W. F. Halsall&rsquo;s fine painting of the Mayflower in
Plymouth Harbor hangs on the north wall inclosed
by portraits of the Winslow family.</p>
<p>Many engravings of historic interest, including
the Signing of the Compact.</p>
<p>Patent of the Plymouth Colony. This is the
oldest state document in New England. It bears
the date of June 1, 1621, was granted to John Peirce
and came over in the ship Fortune in November,
1621. It shows the seals and signatures of the Duke
of Lenox, the Marquis of Hamilton, the Earl of
Warwick, Lord Sheffield and Sir Fernando Gorges.
Several parts of this ancient document have broken
away, including the seal of Hamilton and the seal
and signature of John Peirce, the party of the
second part thereto. This charter includes the
territory in and around Cape Cod Bay, outside that
allotted in the first charter which had covered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
territory to the south in the neighborhood of the
Virginia Capes. This second charter was granted
by the Council for New England, which had been
created by royal authority after the departure of
the Pilgrims from Plymouth, England.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>There is a basement in which are stored relics of
a somewhat later period. In fact, the building is
so filled with interesting reminders of the early
Colonial days that it would be useless to enumerate
them here. There is a complete catalogue obtainable
at the hall which will be a great aid to the
visitor as each article is described in detail. The
Hall is open daily to visitors. Admission twenty-five
cents.</p>
<h3 id="c14">THE PILGRIM SOCIETY</h3>
<p>The Pilgrim Society held its first meeting after
incorporation in the Court House in Plymouth on
May 18th, 1820, and elected Mr. Joshua Thomas
its first president. It was the result of a previous
meeting of Plymouth gentlemen at the home of
Mr. Thomas, who were inspired with a desire to
perpetuate the memory of the first settlers.</p>
<p>Four years later the original home of the society
was erected upon its present location and upon
plans of Alexander Parris, architect of the Boston
Cathedral of St. Paul. This building as before
stated was remodeled in 1880 and the wing which
now houses the library and other Pilgrimiana was
added in 1904. The present granite facade was a
gift of the New England Society in New York
in 1922.</p>
<p>Across the street from Pilgrim Hall and a little
to the north is the Armory previously referred to,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
while a few steps beyond is St. Peter&rsquo;s Catholic
Church. At this point on the east side of Court
Street is the Plymouth Memorial Building, also
previously described. This building stands on the
lot formerly occupied by the colonial residence
built in 1809 by Major William Hammett and later
and for many years occupied by Mr. Thomas Hedge
and family. When the erection of the Memorial
Building was decided upon, this house was moved
back and now faces Water Street and the harbor.
It is reminiscent of the early 19th century and is
maintained and kept open to visitors during the
summer by the Plymouth Antiquarian Society.</p>
<h3 id="c15">WATSON&rsquo;S HILL</h3>
<p>Market Street, which parallels Main Street
Extension, runs from Town Square southward,
converging with Sandwich and Pleasant Streets at
its base. Beyond and to the right is Watson&rsquo;s Hill
from which place Massasoit and his braves
approached the settlement, crossing the brook at
the ford below on their way to the Common House
where the famous treaty was consummated. An
excellent view of the town is to be had from this
elevation, originally a corn field and for generations
a section of attractive homes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>

<p class="pcap">OLD DOORWAYS ON SUMMER STREET</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c16">SUMMER STREET AND MORTON PARK</h3>
<p>Summer street leads westerly from Market
Street, being one of the first streets laid out. Here
may be seen two of the oldest houses in Plymouth,
viz.: the Richard Sparrow House on the left of the
street and a short distance from Market Street and
the Leach House a few steps beyond at the Corner
of Spring Street, once known as Spring Lane. This
house was built by George Bonum in 1679.</p>
<p>The Sparrow House is presumed to have been
built by Richard Sparrow in 1640. If so, it is the
oldest house in Plymouth. Inside it is distinctive
of the early 17th century era with its great fireplace
and its brick oven.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Note:</span> Spring Street has been referred to as Spring Lane
and Baptist Hill, the latter designation derived from
the fact that a Baptist chapel occupied a lot for many
years on the west side a few steps from Summer Street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>This house is now used as craftsman&rsquo;s shop by
the Plymouth Potters, and is open to visitors.</p>
<p>Plymouth Pottery is unique in that it is made
up of local red-firing clay by former pupils of a
State Vocational Project&mdash;now organized into a
co-operative guild.</p>
<p>Many pieces have an early American flavor and
the hand-ground glazes give interesting and
unusual effects. Many persons have called these
pieces &ldquo;heirlooms of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summer Street follows the brook along which
were many manufacturing concerns a short generation
ago. It leads to the wooded area of the
town past Oak Grove and Pine Hills Cemeteries
to Morton Park, a woodland sanctuary of nearly
340 acres situated about a mile from the town&rsquo;s
center. This land was given to the town by a
group of Plymouth citizens in 1889, headed by Mr.
Nathaniel Morton, who was himself a generous
contributor.</p>
<p>The Park includes two lakes of sparkling fresh
water, Little Pond which covers approximately
40 acres and where accommodations are provided
for picnics and bathing, and Billington Sea,
covering an area of over three hundred acres.</p>

<br />The only house in Plymouth where Pilgrims once lived</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h3 id="c17">THE TRAINING GREEN</h3>
<p>Lying just below Watson&rsquo;s Hill between Pleasant
Street on the west and Sandwich Street on the
east, is an open square known as Training Green,
from the fact that in the earlier days companies of
militia were trained there in the manual of arms.
In the center stands the Soldiers&rsquo; Monument,
erected in 1869 to the memory of Plymouth men
who served in the army and navy and who gave
their lives during the Civil War. This tract of
land was used before the arrival of the Pilgrims
by the Indians for growing corn. It has contributed
its share of arrow heads and other Indian relics,
as have the other hills and fields in the immediate
neighborhood.</p>
<h3 id="c18">SANDWICH STREET, OLD HOUSES</h3>
<p>Sandwich Street runs southeasterly from the
foot of Market Street, formerly Spring Hill. Near
this point on the west side of Sandwich Street,
near the head of Water Street, is the Howland
House, built in 1666. It was the home of Jabez
Howland, son of John Howland of the Mayflower,
who died in 1672.</p>
<p>This house is now owned by the Society of
Howland Descendants which holds annual reunions
for the purpose of keeping alive the family intercourse
and the traditions of the early colonial days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h3 id="c19">THE HARLOW HOUSE</h3>

<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="519" />
<p class="pcap">HARLOW HOUSE (1677)</p>
<p class="pcapc">The Harlow House, now a museum of 17th century life, is
maintained by the Plymouth Antiquarian Society</p>
</div>
<p>Just beyond on the west side of Sandwich Street
(No. 119) is the William Harlow House, built in
1677.</p>
<p>A transfer of land on which this house stands is
in the town records under date of July 29, 1669, as
follows: &ldquo;att this meeting a quarter of an acre of
land was granted to William Harlow being a little
Knowle or smale psell of land lying nere his now
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
dwelling house on the westerly syde of the Road
Way To sett a new house upon.&rdquo; (sic) Timbers
used in the construction of this house were taken
from the old fort on Burial Hill.</p>
<p>The Plymouth Antiquarian Society acquired this
property with the object of preserving a fine
example of the homes of the early settlement. Here
may be seen the spinning wheel, the pots and
kettles and other articles of domestic use necessary
to the family upkeep three centuries and over ago.</p>
<p>The Society also maintains the Antiquarian
House on Water Street, which is preserved as it
was in early Colonial days and is well worth a visit.</p>
<h3 id="c20">THE KENDALL HOLMES HOUSE</h3>
<p>This house was built by William Harlow in 1654
and later acquired by Kendall Holmes. It is
located on Winter Street, east of Sandwich Street.
The house stands as originally built except for the
ell which was added later. In both furnishings
and construction it provides a fine example of the
houses of the early colonial period.</p>
<p>A short distance beyond is Jabez Corner. Here
the roads diverge, the road to the right leading to
Chiltonville, once known as Eel River, an attractive
community village one and one-half miles distant.</p>
<p>Straight ahead Warren Avenue follows the shore.
This is one of Plymouth&rsquo;s most picturesque and
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
delightful residential sections with its view of
harbor and bay, and its expanse of unbroken
terrain as it slopes toward the water, all within
easy access to the business center.</p>
<p>One mile to the south is the Plymouth Beach
Club and a short distance beyond at the point
where Plymouth Beach extends along the inner
harbor and Eel River enters the harbor, are the
splendid facilities for public bathing provided by
the Town of Plymouth. A half mile beyond, near
Hotel Pilgrim, is the 18-hole golf course of the
Plymouth Country Club, one of the finest in the
country.</p>
<p>Here the roads diverge again. The road to the
left follows the shore, although at points high
above the water, while the road to the right runs
directly over the Pine Hills.</p>
<p>These hills were included in the early division
of land designated as the &ldquo;Great Lots&rdquo; in 1711-12,
and later transferred by deed at various times and
to various ownerships. At points they reach an
altitude of 400 feet above sea level. The roads
running nearly parallel, meet at the point three
miles south where the Manomet church stands at
the southeast corner of the intersection.</p>
<p>One-half mile to the east is White Horse Beach
which, during the past few years, has developed
into a large summer colony. The beach between
White Horse and Manomet Point affords excellent
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
bathing, and boats with tackle for sea fishing are
readily obtainable.</p>
<p>Nearby to the south is Hotel Mayflower, and
at the &ldquo;Point&rdquo; below, the Manomet Coast Guard
Station. Manomet Village lies to the west, and on
the bluff overlooking the bay is Hotel Idlewild
(formerly the Barstow House).</p>
<p>Southward stretch wide acres of fields and
meadows, hills and vales dotted here and there by
farms and gardens, a variation of landscape that
is typical of New England. Hundreds of acres
devoted to cranberry culture may be seen from the
highway, an indication of the high state of development
this industry has reached.</p>
<p>From many points of vantage along the entire
shore, coastwise traffic via the Cape Cod Canal
may be seen heading north and south.</p>
<p>The Town of Plymouth is fortunate in having
this wide expanse of adaptable terrain within its
confines. The entire area with its scenic beauty,
its woods, its lakes, its bay, its beaches, its rocks,
its foliage and flowers, is a natural heritage, which,
combined with man&rsquo;s handiwork, is becoming
more and more inviting, not only as a haven of rest
and recreation, but as the ideal American homesite.</p>

</div>
<p>The migration of the Pilgrim company was
the result of years of friction between the
adherents of the established Church of
England with its perfunctory ritualisms and those
who demanded the right to worship according to
their conscience and the simplicity of the gospel as
exemplified in the scriptures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>This determined attitude on the part of the
dissenters was met by arbitrary rulings on the part
of the reigning monarch, King James I, of England
and the bishops who received their support from
the crown. The oppression became so great that in
1608 the congregation of the Pilgrim Church at
Scrooby moved to Amsterdam, Holland, whence
in 1609 they moved to Leyden, twenty-two miles
distant. Here they remained for twelve years. It
was a temporary refuge, however. There was the
constantly growing fear of assimilation into Dutch
life and habits as well as the absorption of a
language foreign to themselves and their posterity.
They preferred to remain English men and women
although their relations had been friendly with the
Dutch who commended their industry and their
peaceful contacts. Nevertheless, King James was
beginning to exercise his influence in the low
countries again much to their discomfiture.</p>
<p>Finally deciding to leave Leyden, application
was made to the Virginia Company which had
been established in 1606, and held patents to land
along the Atlantic coast of North America from the
34th to 45th degrees of north latitude, for a patent
to land suitable for settlement.</p>
<p>Having secured their patent, estates were liquidated
and, with the proceeds therefrom, together
with money subscribed by the London company,
styled the Merchant Adventurers, with whom they
had formed a business alliance, the Speedwell, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
small vessel of sixty tons, was secured and sent to
Delfthaven to transport the colonists to Southampton
where the Mayflower, a vessel of one hundred
and eighty tons, was to join them.</p>
<p>On the 15th of August, 1620, both vessels left
Southampton, but the Speedwell proving unseaworthy,
they were obliged to return, putting into
the harbor of Dartmouth for repairs. A second
attempt resulted in abandoning the Speedwell at
Plymouth, from which port the Mayflower sailed
alone on the 16th of September. After a tempestuous
voyage of sixty-six days,
refuge was taken in Cape Cod
harbor (Provincetown) on
November 21st, 1620.</p>
<p>From here exploring parties
set out in the shallop (small boat)
to locate a
suitable home
site and on
December
21st a landing
was made at
Plymouth, the
Mayflower
following on
December
26th. And here a permanent settlement was

<p>As the patent they held covered land in the
vicinity of the Virginia capes, and settlement was
made outside the limits defined therein, a second
patent was obtained covering land contiguous to
Cape Cod Bay. This second patent was brought
over in the Fortune in 1621 and is now preserved
in Pilgrim Hall.</p>
<p>It was while the Mayflower lay in Provincetown
harbor that, to quote from Mourt&rsquo;s Relation under
date of November 23rd, 1620, &ldquo;Our people went
on shore to refresh themselves and our women to
wash as they had great need.&rdquo; This was on Monday,
and is supposed to be the origin of our national
&ldquo;Wash Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was here also that the famous document referred
to by Bradford as a &ldquo;combination&rdquo; but later
known as the Compact was drawn and signed.
This document has often been referred to as the
genesis of our present form of constitutional government
as expounded in the Constitution of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
United States and later expressed by Lincoln as
&ldquo;of the people, by the people and for the people.&rdquo;
It anticipates future growth and development and
the enactment of laws necessary to meet changing
conditions as &ldquo;by vertue hereof to enacte, constitute
and frame such just &amp; equall lawes, ordinances,
Acts, constitutions &amp; offices, from time to time, as
shall be thought most meete &amp; conuenient for ye
generall good of ye Colonie.&rdquo; (sic)</p>
<p>It has been said of the Pilgrims that &ldquo;They
builded better than they knew.&rdquo; This should not
be interpreted too literally. They laid a solid
foundation upon which future generations could
and did build, and upon this foundation rests the
security of the structure that is our present form
of government.</p>

<p>During the first year the colony was reduced
nearly one-half through exposure and disease.
These losses were later offset by arrivals in the
Fortune in 1621 and the Little James in 1623.</p>
<p>In April, 1621, a treaty was made with Massasoit,
chief of the Wampanoag Indians, who occupied
the surrounding territory. This was brought about
through the good offices of Samoset and Squanto,
two friendly Indians, the former having learned
some English from contact with fishermen along
the coast of Maine whence he had come, while the
latter had been taken with a number of others by
a Captain Hunt who had &ldquo;got them under cover of
trucking with them and carried them away and
sold them as slaves.&rdquo; He had made his escape
and returned to his home with the Nausets on
Cape Cod.</p>
<p>This treaty was held inviolate during the life of
Massasoit and thereafter until the outbreak of the
King Philip War in 1675. Precautionary measures
were taken however to protect the settlement, and
in 1622 a fort was erected on Burial Hill. This
was supplemented by a watch tower in 1643.
During the King Philip War a larger fort was
erected on the same site. Fortunately the Plymouth
colony escaped Indian attack although in 1676
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
a small community to the south near Eel River
was attacked and eleven settlers killed.</p>
<p>It is hard to realize in these days of material
comforts, not to speak of luxuries, the hardships
of our forebears. It was a case of work for survival.
And there must have been work for by December,
1621, &ldquo;seven dwelling houses and four for the use
of the plantation&rdquo; had been erected. The harvest
of 1621 had been successful and a season of
Thanksgiving had been observed, wherein some
of the friendly Indians had participated, this being
the origin of our present Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless their existence was fraught with
uncertainties. Their stocks of provisions were soon
depleted and the problem of food supply became
one of increasing concern. The very life of the
colony depended upon the success of their crops.
Corn had become increasingly valuable, not only
as an article of food but as a medium of exchange,
the colonists having little or no money.</p>
<p>Up to 1623 they worked together on company
land, sharing the fruits of their combined labor.
This year owing to the shortage of crops &ldquo;they
begane to think how they might raise as much
corne as they could and abtaine a better crope than
they had done that they might not still thus
languish in miserie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h3 id="c23">LAND DIVIDED</h3>
<p>And so &ldquo;to every family was assigned a parcell
of land according to the proportion of their number
for that end (but made no provision for inheritance)
and ranged all boys &amp; youths under some
family. This had very good success for it made all
hands industrious, so as much more corne was
planted then other waise would have bene by any
means the Governor or any other could use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was followed the next season by a division
of land wherein &ldquo;to every person was given only
one acre, to them and theirs, as near the towne as
might be, and they had no more till the seven years
were expired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Note:</span> This was in accordance, at least in spirit, with
the imposed provisions of their contract with the
English company of Merchant Adventurers who had
financed their expedition.</p>
<p>A further division of land, following a division
of livestock, was made in 1627, wherein &ldquo;every
person or share should have 20 acres of land
divided unto them, besides the single acres they
had already.&rdquo; (sic).</p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Quotations from Bradford&rsquo;s History of Plymouth Plantation</span></p>
<h3 id="c24">THEY CARRY ON</h3>
<p>Fortified by faith and grim determination the
colonists carried on in the face of great adversity,
yet getting more and more firmly established.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>In 1636, owing to the growth of the original
colony or plantation and the establishment of
separate settlements at Scituate and Duxbury, the
purely democratic rule which had obtained under
the Mayflower Compact, wherein matters pertaining
to the interests of the colony were settled
in general assembly, was superseded by a law
passed providing for government by deputies
representing the several towns.</p>
<p>The first legislative body met in 1639 and brought
together representatives from the outlying towns
of Sandwich, Barnstable, Yarmouth, Taunton,
Scituate, Duxbury and Plymouth.</p>
<p>In 1643, for mutual interests and against the
menace of Indian attack, a confederation was
formed between the Plymouth and Massachusetts
colonies in combination with Connecticut and New
Haven as separate units, with authority vested in
commissioners.</p>
<p>This remained in force until 1672 when a new
compact was made upon the union of Connecticut
and New Haven, which gave less authority to the
commissioners.</p>
<p>In 1686 Sir Edmund Andros was sent by King
James to rule over the Dominion of New England,
to which in 1688 New York and New Jersey were
added, the seat of government remaining in
Boston.</p>
<p>Conditions under Andros with his autocratic
assumptions and restrictions were not pleasant.
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
It is interesting to note in this connection that
Clark&rsquo;s Island which had for some time been used
for the support of the poor, was turned over by
Andros to one of his followers who had been
attracted by its natural beauties.</p>
<p>The ascension of William III to the throne of
England in 1689 had much to do with shaping the
destinies of the colonists. The regime of Andros
continued until word was received that the landing
of William, Prince of Orange, in England threatened
the overthrow of the Stuart dynasty when
the citizens of Boston revolted, took possession of
a British ship in the harbor and overthrew the
crown&rsquo;s despotic representative. Plymouth again
acquired Clark&rsquo;s Island and later the proclamation
of William and Mary established once more the
freedom the colonists had previously enjoyed.</p>
<p>In 1692 came the union of the Massachusetts Bay
and Plymouth colonies. Sir William Phipps was
appointed by the crown chief magistrate over the
Massachusetts Colony with which the Plymouth
Colony was united under one royal charter.</p>

<p>Cranberries, growing wild on Cape Cod, were made into
cranberry sauce by an unknown Pilgrim housewife. The
Indians ate their cranberries raw, but the Pilgrim ladies
stewed them with sugar as they did other fruits ... thus,
cranberry sauce!</p>

Spray Cranberry Sauce.
